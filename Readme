3D Landscape Image Slider

This is a web development project that creates a 3D rotating image carousel. Instead of just sliding left and right, the images rotate in a ring formation using CSS 3D transforms.

How to Run
1. Download the `index.html` file.
2. Open it in any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3. The slider should start rotating automatically.

Features
1. 3D Rotation: Images are arranged in a circle and spin when navigating.
2. Auto-Play: The slider moves to the next image every 3 seconds.
3. Progress Bar: A blue bar at the bottom shows when the next slide will happen.
4. Responsive: It adjusts the size of the 3D ring for mobile screens vs desktop screens.
5. Reflection Effect: Images have a cool reflection at the bottom using CSS.
