# 3D Landscape Image Slider

This is a web development project that creates a 3D rotating image carousel. Instead of just sliding left and right, the images rotate in a ring formation using CSS 3D transforms.

## How to Run
1. Download the `index.html` file.
2. Open it in any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3. The slider should start rotating automatically.

## Features
* **3D Rotation:** Images are arranged in a circle and spin when navigating.
* **Auto-Play:** The slider moves to the next image every 3 seconds.
* **Progress Bar:** A blue bar at the bottom shows when the next slide will happen.
* **Responsive:** It adjusts the size of the 3D ring for mobile screens vs desktop screens.
* **Reflection Effect:** Images have a cool reflection at the bottom using CSS.

## How to Customize
If you want to change the images, open `index.html` in a code editor (like VS Code or Notepad).

Look for this part in the `<script>` section:

```javascript
var photoData = [
    { src: 'https://...', title: 'Misty Mountains' },
    ...
];
